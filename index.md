## About
I'm a PhD student in Physics at the University of Maryland, College Park. My primary research interests are in Quantum Computing - specifically, Quantum Algorithms and Quantum Complexity Theory. I'm also interested in both quantum and classical machine learning. I'm fortunate to be advised by Professor [Alexey Gorshkov](https://groups.jqi.umd.edu/gorshkov/) and Professor [Andrew Childs](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~amchilds/).

My studies at UMD are supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

## Background

I completed my undergrad at UC Berkeley in 2019 with a B.A. in Physics and Computer Science. 

While at Berkeley, I worked with Professor Birgitta Whaley towards using tensor networks for Quantum Machine Learning, and implementing our tree tensor network models on Rigetti's Quantum Computer. I also did research in experimental particle physics with the ATLAS collaboration under Professor Marjorie Shapiro, where I worked on projects involving new inner detector designs for the LHC as well as searches for Dark Matter candidate particles.

## Professional Experience

### QCB
I am the founder and former president of [Quantum Computing @ Berkeley](https://qcb.berkeley.edu/), an undergraduate club aiming to spread quantum computing knowledge and connect industry, academia, and students. I also created and taught a DeCal (student run course) on [quantum computing](https://qcb.berkeley.edu/decal.shtml) in Fall 2018.

### Software Engineering
In Summer 2017, I interned at Sonos on the Partner Integrations team, working on app development across Android, iOS, and Windows.
In Summer 2018, I interned at Amazon on the AWS Rekognition team, where I worked on developing pipelines for different face detection and recognition models.
