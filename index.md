## About
I'm a Senior Research Scientist at IonQ working on quantum computing. 

My research is guided by two questions: 
 1. What are quantum computers good for? 
 2. How do we build a quantum computer?
    
My work spans quantum compilation, quantum algorithms, and complexity theory, with a focus on connecting theory to practical architectures and implementations.

## Background

I earned my Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Maryland, where I was supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and an LPS Quantum Graduate Fellowship, and I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Alexey Gorshkov](https://groups.jqi.umd.edu/gorshkov/) and Professor [Andrew Childs](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~amchilds/).

I completed my undergrad at UC Berkeley in 2019 with a B.A. in Physics and Computer Science. 

While at Berkeley, I did research with Professor Birgitta Whaley in quantum computing. I also did research in experimental particle physics with the ATLAS collaboration under Professor Marjorie Shapiro, where I worked on projects involving new inner detector designs for the LHC as well as searches for Dark Matter candidate particles.

## Professional Experience
### Quantum Computing
IBM Research (Summer 2024) - Quantum Research Intern. At IBM, I worked on fermionic encodings and fault-tolerant compilation.

Zapata Computing (Summer 2022) - Quantum AI Research Intern. At Zapata I worked on a project related to mitigation of Barren Plateaus in Quantum Neural Networks.

### QCB
I am the founder and former president of [Quantum Computing @ Berkeley](https://qcb.berkeley.edu/), an undergraduate club aiming to spread quantum computing knowledge and connect industry, academia, and students. I also created and taught a DeCal (student run course) on [quantum computing](https://qcb.berkeley.edu/decal.shtml) in Fall 2018.

### Software Engineering
In Summer 2017, I interned at Sonos on the Partner Integrations team, working on app development across Android, iOS, and Windows.
In Summer 2018, I interned at Amazon on the AWS Rekognition team, where I worked on developing pipelines for different face detection and recognition models.
