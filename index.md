# About
I'm a PhD student in Physics at the University of Maryland, College Park. My primary research interests are in Quantum Computing - specifically, Quantum Algorithms and Quantum Information Theory. I'm also interested in both quantum and classical machine learning. 

I completed my undergrad at UC Berkeley in 2019 with a B.A. in Physics and Computer Science. While at Berkeley, I worked with Professor Birgitta Whaley towards using tensor networks for Quantum Machine Learning, and implementing our tree tensor network models on Rigetti's Quantum Computer. I also did research in experimental particle physics with the ATLAS collaboration under Professor Marjorie Shapiro, where I worked on projects involving new inner detector designs for the LHC as well as searches for Dark Matter candidate particles in Mono-Higgs decay.

I am the founder of Quantum Computing @ Berkeley.
